## Introduction 
A Self Organizing Map is a type of unsupervised artificial neural network that uses competitive learning to represent high-dimensional input data in a lower-dimensional space. This project uses SOMs to detect potentially fraudulent credit card applications by identifying outliers in the application data.

### Features 
* Fraud detection based on credit card application data
* Unsupervised learning using Self Organizing Maps
* Visualization of the SOM's output
* Easy-to-use command line interface

## Requirement
* Python 3.0 +
* Numpy
* Pandas
* TensorFlow
* Scikit-learn

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jliu0105/fraud_detector.git
```
